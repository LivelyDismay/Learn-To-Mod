# Preamble

---

### Magnum Opus

Magnum Opus is what one would describe as a "kitchen sink list." There is no specific focus or aspect I really care about. There is no set goal I'm trying to achieve. I just want to have fun.

This means if I like a mod, it's going in. There is no such thing as "it doesn't fit my aesthetic" or "it goes against the theme of the list." The theme is fun.

To that end, I like new content. I like new areas, new quests, new NPCs, new weapons, new outfits, new faces. You'll find all of that - and a whole lot more - in this list. I genuinely hope you enjoy it as much as I do.

This list is NOT built with Survival Mode in mind. I don't play it. I don't like it. If you want Survival, you should play [Fallout 4 Enhanced Edition](https://www.wabbajack.org/modlist/wj-featured/fallout_4_enhanced_edition) or [Life in the Ruins](https://www.wabbajack.org/modlist/wj-featured/life_in_the_ruins).

Is Magnum Opus for you? I don't know, but [this video by DroppedIceCream might help you decide](https://youtu.be/Q2s84pTpkwE).

**Please read this readme in its entirety.**

**Please read the FAQ again before reporting an issue or asking me a question.**

**Please consult the in-game Magnum Opus Beginner's Guide terminal (which also has a holotape for a portable version of the terminal!) outside Vault 111 before alt-tabbing out to Discord to ask for my help.**

## Installation

---

### Pre-Installation

You need a legal copy of Fallout 4 through Steam, with all DLCs **EXCEPT** the High Definition DLC. This is garbage and should not be used in any case ever.

These steps are only needed if you install this Modlist for the first time. If you update the Modlist, jump straight to [Updating](#updating).

#### Installing Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Packages

These packages are required for MO2 and for the BiRaitBec Texture Optimization step respectively, and you can download them from [Microsoft](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads).

##### Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2022

Download the x64 version under [Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2022](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170#visual-studio-2015-2017-2019-and-2022).

[Direct Link](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) if you can't find it.

##### Visual Studio 2012 (VC++ 11.0) Update 4

Download the x64 version under [Visual Studio 2012 (VC++ 11.0) Update 4](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170#visual-studio-2012-vc-110-update-4).

[Direct Link](https://download.microsoft.com/download/1/6/B/16B06F60-3B20-4FF2-B699-5E9B7962F9AE/VSU_4/vcredist_x64.exe) if you can't find it.

#### Steam Config

#### Change Steams Update Behavior

Fallout 4 is still being updated by Bethesda (they only add Creation Club content). Whenever the game updates, the entire modding community goes silent for the next one or two weeks because some mods need to be updated to the latest game runtime version.

To ensure that Steam does not automatically updates the game for you, head over to the Properties window, navigate to the _Updates_ tab and change _Automatic updates_ to _Only update this game when I launch it_. You should also disable the Steam Cloud while you're at it.

#### Set the Game language to English

Just do it. This entire Modlist is in English and 99% of all mods you will find are also in English. I highly recommend playing the game in English and **I will not give support to people with a non-English game**. I really wish I could, but at this time, it simply isn't feasible.

Open the Steam Properties window, navigate to the _Language_ tab and select _English_ from the dropdown menu.

#### Clean Fallout 4

I highly recommend uninstalling the game through Steam, deleting the game folder and reinstalling it. You should also clean up the `Fallout 4` folder in `Documents/My Games/`. **Make sure you run the game once** to establish your registry path - otherwise, Wabbajack will be unable to locate the game directory, and thus cannot install the modlist.

---

### Using Wabbajack

---

#### Preparations

Let's get to the actual installation..

Grab the latest release of Wabbajack from [here](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/) (just click the big blue Download button). Place the `Wabbajack.exe` file in a blank folder at the root of a drive, such as `C:/Wabbajack`. Please do not put it in a Windows Protected Directory, such as Program Files or your Desktop.

Launch Wabbajack. The exe will download the rest of the program from Github and extract itself wherever you placed the exe. When it is finished extracting and installing itself, select the `Browse Modlists` option. Click the Download arrow for Magnum Opus, and you will be forwarded to the next screen when it is finished.

Set the `Installation Location` to a blank folder at the root of a drive, such as `D:\Magnum Opus`. The `Download Location` will update automatically. Again, please avoid using Windows Protected Directories.

Click the `Play` arrow. If you have a Nexus Premium account, all of your downloads will be automated. Without Premium, you will need to manually click the Download button for each mod. Installation will be automated regardless of your account status.

### Problems with Wabbajack

There are a lot of different scenarios where Wabbajack will produce an error. I recommend re-running Wabbajack before posting anything. Wabbajack will continue where it left off so you lose no progress.

- **I'm having problems downloading a few files**

The most common files that fail to download through Wabbajack are as follows:
  -  [Tattoos Collection by Dreivor Overlays Edition (TCD)](https://www.nexusmods.com/Core/Libs/Common/Widgets/DownloadPopUp?id=232053&game_id=1151iles)
  -  [More Hairstyles - Beards](http://www.mediafire.com/file/iztz7iidy6djz1e/MoreHairstyles-Beards.rar/file)
  -  [Misc Hairstyles 1.6](http://www.mediafire.com/file/kfac38dni6d53rp/MiscHairstyle1.6_by_Atherisz.7z/file)
  -  [FO4 Lodgen Resources](https://mega.nz/file/BZhlVCAJ#s-GqqbnJlZDvCLPiRw1Wm1EWGqMQCuh4CR8Zzn8POM4)

Download these files manually, paste them into your `downloads` folder that you specified for Wabbajack, then rerun the installation.

Need help with something else? [Join my Discord server for live support.](https://discord.gg/yABEjwB)

- **Wabbajack could not find my game folder**:

Wabbajack will not work with a pirated version of the game. If you own the game on Steam, go back to the [Pre-Installation](#pre-installation) step.

---

## Updating

If this Modlist receives an update, please check the Changelog before doing anything. Always backup your saves or start a new game after updating.

Magnum Opus updates based on a [Semantic Versioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning) system.

Generally speaking:  
- Full x.0 (2.0, 3.0, etc) updates requires a new game.  
- Major x.x (2.1, 2.2 etc) updates requires a new game.  
- Minor x.x.x (2.1.1, 2.1.2) updates can be applied to an ongoing playthrough.

**Wabbajack will delete all files that are not part of the Modlist when updating!**

This means that any additional mods you have installed on top of the Modlist will be deleted. Your downloads folder will not be touched!

If you wish for Wabbajack to ignore any additional mods you've installed, rename them to say `[NoDelete]` at the beginning of the name.

Updating is like installing. You only have to make sure that you select the same path and tick the _overwrite existing Modlist_ button.

---

## Post Installation

This section [has been moved to its own page, just to really make it stand out in its importance.](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/main/wabbajack-stuff/Opus-Readme-Post-Install.md) **Magnum Opus WILL CRASH CONSTANTLY if you do not do this part.**

## Noteworthy Mods

### Sim Settlements 2

Rebuild the Commonwealth with a mysterious stranger in a brand new, fully voiced, and - quite frankly - absolutely amazing questline in this highly anticipated sequel-of-sorts to the original Sim Settlements. 

Read more about it [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/47976)!

### Creative Perks Plus

Perk overhaul built on top of another perk overhaul. Fancy!

Do note that this mod is edited a bit for Magnum Opus, so not all the perks you see on this mod page will match up perfectly with this modlist's perk chart. This is not a bug, nor is it an issue with Whisky's mod! It is intended!

Read more about it [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/49400)!

### This is Trash - A Scrapping Alternative

I got tired of individually scrapping every single leaf and rubbish pile every time I started a new game, so I took some inspiration from Wabbajack and automated it. Each settlement will now have a trash can next to the workbench. Scrap it and watch as the area is miraculously cleaned of all those stupid looking shrubs and garbage decals.

Read more about it [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/42552)!

### Buffout 4

The equivalent of SSE Engine Fixes, Buffout basically makes lists like this possible. Memory patches, achievements enabler, memory leak warnings, and so much more. This is likely the single most important mod in the entire list.

## Creation Club Support

Magnum Opus now has support for some Creation Club mods as of version 3.2 of the modlist. To make use of this, you must follow a few steps:
1. Click the profile dropdown menu at the top left of Mod Organizer 2, and make sure the active profile is set to `Magnum Opus`.
2. Launch the game and download your CC mods from the in-game storefront.
  -  Launching the game from Mod Organizer 2 will make all the creations download into your `overwrite` folder, which will make the next step a bit easier.
3. Cut and paste all of your CC mods into `Magnum Opus\mods\Creation Club Content`. 
4. Activate the `Creation Club Content` mod in Mod Organizer 2, then change the active profile to `Magnum Opus - CC Edition`.
  -  Please take note that **you will need all of the CC mods listed below** in order for the CC Edition profile to work. The list of required Creations is below:

</details>

Pipboy Paint Jobs and Power Armor Paint Jobs are **NOT** supported.

If you have a Missing Masters warning in Mod Organizer 2 after following this set of instructions for the Creation Club profile, then there are CC mods in this list you don't have.

If you have CC mods that aren't in this list, that means I don't own them (yet?), so I cannot provide support. I'm doing my best here, please bear with me.

You may also notice some other mods are deactivated in the CC Profile - namely, some armors, power armors, and weapons. This is because some CC mods act as pseudo variants of these, and I didn't want "doubles" essentially.

## A Few Quick Notes

 - It is recommended that you leave Vault 111 prior to reporting any issues to me. Please.
 - Your Pipboy flashlight will not work between the time you pick it up and the time you press the button to open the vault door. It genuinely amazes me how many people report this to me. Just press the button, it's right there.
 - Sim Settlements 2: Chapter 2 is still in very active development. **Please do not update this mod on your own.** Granted, you shouldn't be updating *any* mod on your own, and doing so **will** void all support.
 - You will get a few pop-ups upon exiting Vault 111. For ECO, select this option:

I don't own a widescreen monitor, so I can't help directly. I don't mind you guys helping each other though, obviously. A generous discord user by the name of bjdripley wrote an [Ultrawide Compatibility Guide for Magnum Opus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EbZ_DpyhctsrpBlylDYc2TXtm1NAOjkcYjRCNZsC958/edit) that you may find useful.
