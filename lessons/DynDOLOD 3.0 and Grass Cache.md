## Intro
So you’ve got your modlist all nice and ready and are now onto the process of creating lods for your game. But how do I do them, and what on earth is a grass cache?

Well, you’re in luck as this guide goes over how to do it. I’ll not be covering all the settings, rather just how to run it and what you’ll need to run it. This guide is also only for Mod Organizer 2 users. If you are new to MO2, Wartortle has created a guide that you can follow [here](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/58b4e895fd7885a0bd703b3b86685961d479fd2e/lessons/Introduction%20to%20MO2.md).

## What you will need

Here is a list of things you will need: 

- The latest [xLODGen and SSE Tamriel Extended.esm](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54680)  
- [DynDOLOD 3.00](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32382)  
- [DynDOLOD 3.00 Resources](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52897)  
- [No Grass In Objects](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42161) (Only needed if you want grass LOD. You also need the MO2 NGIO plugin in the same page)
- [Landscape Fixes for Grass Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9005)
- [Worldspaces with Grass SSEEdit Script](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55152)  

## The Main Steps

### Installing Everything
xLodGen and DynDOLOD should be installed to the `Tools` folder of wherever your Mod Organizer is. In my case, it’s `Tinvaak\Tools`. Once they are there, open your Mod Organizer. Create a new mod named `Grass Cache`.  Add the x64 versions of xLODGen, TexGen and DynDOLOD as executables. We use x64 because x32 would easily run out of memory on SSE.
Note: You must add `-SSE` to the arguments section for xLODGenx64, TexGenx64 and DynDOLODx64; otherwise they will fail to run.

For xLODGen, after the `-SSE` line, you **must** add the argument `-O:"C:\Path\To\Output"` to ensure that the generated files go to the correct location and also regen the vanilla meshes. This output folder **cannot be in a folder that is read by MO2 to create the virtual file system**. Place it somewhere like `C:\Games\xLODGen Output`. You can either drag the output to an empty mod in mo2 or zip it manually and install.

For the No Grass in Objects pre-cacher, place the plugin in the `plugins` folder of where your Mod Organizer 2 is installed. Relaunch MO2 and it will appear in the tools area (shown as a spanner and screwdriver).

Install DynDOLOD 3.0 Resources, checking all of the options aside from “Low-Res LOD Textures” and “Holy Cow”. You can use the Low-Res LOD if you wish, but I think it’s best not to. Once you have it installed, you want it placed relatively high in your left pane. I have it positioned in the following location:

Finally, you’ll want to install the `SSE-Terrain-Tamriel Extended` ESM. This is only needed during xLODGen and should be placed at the far top of the load order, even above USSEP (since it just needs to add cells and not win conflicts). Once installed, activate it only when you are generating terrain lod with xLODGen and disable it when that is done.

### xLODGen
Once you have all of that installed and the output paths set, activate `SSE-Terrain-Tamriel Extended` and move it to the correct position in the right pane as mentioned in the previous section. If you are using `A Quality World Map`, consider switching to `A Clear Map of Skyrim and Other Worlds`. When using ACMOS you will also need to use the road generator tool after generating terrain LOD as instructed in its page.
Note: Some mods such as Majestic Mountains and Cathedral Landscapes come with files for LOD Generation. You will want to have these files activated during the process of running xLODGen. Majestic Mountains LODs in particular needs to be active all the way through until Occlusion generation.*

Then select xLODGenx64 from the executables dropdown in MO2 and press `Run`. It will proceed to load your entire load order. When it is done, a Dialogue box will open similar to the following:

![alt text](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/main/images/DynDOLODAndGrass3.jpg?raw=true)

Right click in the `Worldspace` area and press `Select All`. Ensure that only Terrain LOD is selected and then apply your LOD settings. I use the Lexy LOTD xLODGen settings, [which can be found here](https://lexyslotd.com/guide/finishing-line/#xlodgen). They provide the best balance of quality and performance. Allow it to run and do its work. When complete, it will say “LOD Generation completed”. You can then close the program.

Navigate to where your xLODGen output folder is and create a zip folder of it. Press the `Add mod from file` button and navigate to where your zipped xLODGen output is. Press the `Open` button and install it as a new mod. Activate the mod and then deactivate `SSE-Terrain-Tamriel` and any other mods that you activated for the xLODGen process.

### Grass Cache (Optional)

**NOTE**: Grass cache **does not function** on builds using a Skyrim.exe **newer than 1.5.97** due to .Net Script framework being incompatible.

Once you have completed xLODGen, it is now time for Grass Cache. Grass Cache is a relatively new technology that allows you to pre-cache grass for all worldspaces in the game. This prevents grass clipping into objects (same goal as the grass landscape fixing mods but no patching needed) and allows for DynDOLOD to create grass LODs to increase the distance which you can see grass and also can give a more stable experience. **Do note that grass LOD will reduce performance**. Before running grass cache, I recommend you use this script [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55152) to determine which locations to cache grass into and make the process faster by skipping cells without grass. Download that script and copy the extracted `pas` file into your xEdit edit scripts folder as shown below:

![alt text](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/main/images/DynDOLODAndGrass4.png?raw=true)

Open xEdit, allow all your plugins to load, and then apply the script. This process can take a while so grab a coffee. Once completed, a textbox will show on screen with the list of worldspaces to generate grass for. 

![alt text](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/main/images/DynDOLODAndGrass5.png?raw=true)

Copy this data and then go into your `No Grass In Objects` mod, open the INI file, and paste the data in between the "" in the `OnlyPregenerateWorldSpaces =` section. It is **vital** this data is in between the quotes, otherwise it will not be read. You can see an example of how it should look below:

![alt text](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/main/images/DynDOLODAndGrass6.png?raw=true)

Staying in the ini file, change the following lines to read the following:

- `UseGrassCache = True`
- `OverwriteGrassDistance = 12000`
- `OverwriteGrassFadeRange = 8000`
- `OnlyLoadFromCache = True`
- `DynDOLODGrassMode = 1`

A note on these settings: to improve performance, you can set the `OverWriteGrassDistance` and `OverwriteGrassFadeRange` to be lower. For the former, a setting of 8000 is a bit more than vanilla and may improve your performance. If you just wish to cache the grass but not for DynDOLOD, change the `DynDOLODGrassMode` back to `0`. `SuperDenseMode` is another section that you can alter if you wish to tone down the grass amount. I leave this set at `7` as it gives a good balance of performance to visuals; however, setting this to `6` can help improve performance.

Next: 

You should check if your grass has object bounds set. Any grass record with no object bounds set will not generate anything during the process and will defeat the point of pre-caching. To do so, first filter your entire load order for grass records like so:

![2021-10-28 01_48_49-Filter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20669755/139170222-0c69f410-27f7-413b-babd-441e195e5ce4.png)

Then copy every record to a new plugin, this can be an esp flagged as esl as it will only contain overwrites:

![2021-10-28 01_50_20-SSEEdit 4 0 3h (Hotfix 1) x64](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20669755/139170231-7fa3986f-1485-418f-95b6-63de4bd03e3f.png)

You then need to open this new plugin in the Creation Kit, highlight all the grass and then right click and recalculate bounds:

![2021-10-28 01_57_36-Object Window](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20669755/139170230-26a5da79-7293-44dc-81c0-4b3e23bc37e5.png)

Then place this patch in a position where it overwrites all of your other grass records.

Before running grass cache, you can do a few more things to speed up the process and to prevent crashes (as this can take several hours depending on how many additional worldspaces you are generating grass for)

1. Reduce your resolution just big enough so you can still see the progress in the console. DO NOT USE BETHINI PRESETS FOR POOR OR LOW QUALITY, this will cause no files to be generated.
2. Deactivate any direct texture replacer mods you have.
3. Disable ENB by renaming the DLL's or using Root Builder
4. Stop any heavy processes in the background
5. Disable TrueHUD (seems to cause repeatable crashes, you can re-enable it once done)

Once you have done all of the above, save the ini file and close it. Go back into MO2, click on the spanner and screwdriver icon, and then select `Pre-Cache Grass`. A pop-up will appear confirming that you wish to do this. Click `Yes`. Go grab a coffee and a good book or magazine - this can take a very long time.

If the game starts crashing over and over on the same cell, then check that cell in xEdit and find the root cause of the crash by also reading the logs created in overwrite.

Once it is completed, a pop-up will appear saying that grass generation has been completed. **If you do not have a mod set to catch files generated during gameplay, the grass will be in the `overwrite` mod at the bottom of your Mod Oragnizer's left pane (assuming you have the mods sorted by `Priority`).** You should see a folder called `grass` with a load of `.cgid` files inside. Move that folder to the mod called `grass cache` that you created. Press `F5` to refresh MO2 and then activate the mod.

### TexGen
Run TexGenx64 and Allow the tool to load your mods and then choose the following settings. **If you are not doing grass lods, untick the grass checkbox.** Note the output path as to where TexGen is sending the output.

![alt text](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/main/images/DynDOLODAndGrass7.png?raw=true)

Press `Start` and allow the tool to generate the textures. Once done, the tool will open a pop-up. Press `Exit` or `Zip&Exit` if you wish to have the output zipped up for easier addition to a mod-manager or redistribution. In this case, we're choosing `Zip&Exit` as that allows us to add the output as a new mod in MO2 easier.

![alt text](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/main/images/DynDOLODAndGrass8.png?raw=true)

Add the output as a new mod in Mod Organizer 2, and then activate it.

### DynDOLOD & Occlusion

#### Enabling advanced mode (Optional)

  - *Note: This portion isn't totally necessary as you can press the advanced button when DynDOLOD opens. I prefer to not have to press that button so set it in the ini file.*

If you want to have DynDOLOD start in advanced mode each time and not have to press the advanced button, you need to edit a line in the `DynDOLOD_SSE.ini` file. Navigate to where your DynDOLOD is located, open up the `Edit Scripts` folder, and then the DynDOLOD folder. Open the `DynDOLOD_SSE.ini` file and change the following lines:  
`Wizard=0`  

If you are using ACMOS, also enable LOD32 in this config file.
Save your changes and reopen MO2.

#### Generation

Ensure that your xLODGen, TexGen and Grass Cache (if using) is active. Run DynDOLODx64 and allow it to load all your mods. In the top left section where it lists worldspaces, right click and press select all. Load the relevant rules that you want, in this case we’ll load medium rules. Set your settings to be the same as this:

![alt text](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/main/images/DynDOLODAndGrass9.png?raw=true)

Another note on settings. billboard brightness is one that you adjust if you find that your LODs are too bright in game. I have this set lower due to some of the tree mods I use. Ultra trees generates 3D tree lod and can be performance-intensive depending on the tree mods you use. Checking `Generate Tree Lod` will generate "Hybrid Lods" which are less performance intensive at the cost of a minor visual decrease in quality. If you have 4GB vram or less, I would recommend not doing Ultra Tree Lod. Anything above `1024` on tile size billboard is not recommended as you are beyond the threshold of visual quality to performance. And finally, the rules govern how DynDOLOD will generate things and at what quality. 

  -  *Note: Certain tree mods require specialised tree rules in order for them to render properly in the worldspace. Known mods that require them include: Myrkvior, Trees Addon SE and Skyrim Flora Overhaul. It is likely there are more tree mods that require special rules.* 

If you wish to generate Grass cache, ensure that the grass lod option is enabled and that the mode is set to `1` as that was the mode that we used for grass generation. You can change the density if you wish, however I have left it as default.

  - *Note: This will not be active if DynDOLOD does not detect grass billboards.*

DynDOLOD 3.0 now includes Occlusion as part of it's toolset so we no longer need to generate Occlusion via xLODGen. I recommend the settings shown in picture above for generation as these are very similar to the original one's used in xLodGen occlusion.
If using ACMOS, now set the LOD32 rules to this:
- `/ to Level0`
- `Tree to Billboard6`

Once you have configured the settings, click `OK` and DynDOLOD will begin generating LOD. This can take a very long time depending on how many worldspaces you have and on your CPU performance (especially scales with CPU core-count). Once it is completed, a pop-up will appear. As with TexGen, you have the option to either `Save & Exit` or `Save & Zip & Exit`. Again, the choice is yours however in this guide we'll choose to zip it up as well.

![alt text](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/main/images/DynDOLODAndGrass10.png?raw=true)

Install the zipped output file as a new mod in MO2, name it `DynDOLOD Output` and activate the mod. On the right pane, `DynDOLOD.esm` should be moved to be the last ESM after your worldspace mods. In my case, that is Wyrmstooth so I place it after `Wyrmstooth.esm`. `DynDOLOD.esp` should be the second last and `Occlusion.esp` shoud be the last plugin in your load order.

You’re all done. Go and enjoy your new and improved Skyrim!
